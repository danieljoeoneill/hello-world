first repository

Hello World,

  My name is Daniel O'Neill and I am currently studying at the University of Southern California's Viterbi School of Engineering for a B.S. in Computer Engineering/Computer Science (Class of 2022). I have created this GitHub to share and build my portfolio while collaborating with other members of the community. Currently, all of my work is in C/C++.
  
  Thanks for reading!
  Daniel
